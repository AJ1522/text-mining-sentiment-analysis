4,Thought it would be a little bigger
2,This is not worth the price. I love my Trader Joe’s canvas bags but this doesn’t even compare. It’s very thin water would go right through it. And it’s small it’s not for a beach bag. I would not buy again it’s way over priced.
5,I've bought this product twice. Both to use for HTV projects. Worked like a dream. Very sturdy and well made product.
5,The tote is roomy and looks good. It accommodates my crocheting projects; however there are no inner pouches. Use your other containers to organize and hold small items. Satisfied.
4,Using this bag for embroidery. Ran 1 item and the results were great. Thought this might have been a little studier and the $$ was a little high for the origin country.
5,Second time ordering these because the quality is sooo nice! Very thick and good material!
5,If your a crafter this take on vinyl perfectly. the only thing i wish it had was a zipper or a snap just to hold it shut but thats not a necessity it is a great size and works like a charm.
5,Our state no longer allows grocery stores to use plastic bags. We have been purchasing sturdy cloth bags for several years. Several features have come to our attention - strength length of the handles washability and closure features. They must be strong enough to carry several 6 packs of drinks with ease. The handles must be long enough to comfortably go on the shoulder when full of items. Inadvertent leaks can cause stains requiring tossing a bag in the washing machine. Closures via magnetic snaps or velcro have proven to be inconvenient when trying to pack our own items quickly. These bags are free of any closure device. The bags can easily be customized with fabric paint to help avoid confusion of ownership in case of a mixup.
5,Well made heavy canvas.
4,I wanted something that was big enough and strong enough to fit books a laptop etc. inside and could be decorated. This fit the bill and for the price you can’t beat it. I had even looked at stores like TJ Maxx and Ross to find a cheap bag like this for a good price but for all the time I spent looking I couldn’t find just a plain one. So save yourself the time and hassle and go straight for this one that will show up at your door in two days.
4,I like the bag. I wished the handles were a tad bit longer; maybe about 2-4 inches longer. It does the job I needed it for.
4,Wanted to try these bags for grocery shopping. I have 2 large heavy canvas bags but needed more and previous source no longer available. These are not as sturdy as I’d like but hope for years of use. They seem strong enough to handle the job.
5,These are much better than the old Kroger in-store reusable bags. Quite heavy and durable handle is strong enough to pack them completely full and the fabric won't get torn by sharp package corners.
5,Thought it was going to be an small sized but it's actually nice and big. Fits a lot. I'm glad I went with this one.
5,I purchased personalized totes for everyone for Christmas. At the last minute a relative who hadn't been home in 8 years decided her and her child would be coming home the day after Christmas. I decided these would suffice to hold their gifts and I'm so glad I did! They are super nice and for the price I paid for one of the others I received 3 of these!! They seem sturdy and look like they would be easy to throw in the wash. I'm going to hit them with some scotchgard prior to filling with gifts in hopes that the white stays white. 
5,The projects turned out great! 
5,I got this to make my mother in law a personalized tote for mother's day and it worked out great. It's just the right size for her to take to the store to go grocery shopping. 
5,These are HUGE and so refined compared to many canvas bags out there. I like that I could buy them three at a time since I put vinyl designs on them for my hobby craft business. These are really classy and smooth. I don't think I'll have any issues with resale even though the price will be higher than the basic cotton canvas bag. I highly recommend. 
5,Super easy to customize and very sturdy! 
3,I chose this bag first because of the ratings and looked like the size that would suit me. It arrived I fell in love with it and it held up pretty much until a month passed and it began ripping along one side???? It isn’t worth the trouble of sending it back I had to switch out to another bag I have that I bought used from a thrift store go figure.
3,The bag is 18” wide when laying flat; that is including the side gussets. So once you open the bag to use it it’s actually only 13” wide. This is much smaller than what I need so I will be returning these and will look for another bag.
3,The canvas from which this bag is made is very heavy rough and stiff even after being washed two times. It is not comfortable to use. The handles do not have quite a large enough opening for me to use over-the-shoulder. As long as the seams hold I predict it will last a long time but I will never really enjoy using it.
3,This tote accomodates my needs; a place to store craft items I don't often use. It's nothing special. It's quite floppy when I pick it up and I only filled it half-way. The handles on my tote already show signs of wear loose threads after just a few months and it generally stays sitting stationary in one place. This replaced an old LL Bean tote and there's no comparison. For one thing the Bean tote was thick waterproof canvas and this is much lighter material. I got my money's worth from the Bean tote it's 20 years old. I don't think this tote bag will last as long!
3,I thought I was going to like this bag but it's not for me. I wear a lot of dark clothes and everytime I used this bag the color of my clothing transfer to the bag.
3,There was no padding in the bottom.
3,In the product photos there's a girl who looks like she's holding a bag half her size. Little bit misrepresenting. Otherwise it's all right
3,The color is white. I use this bag to carry supplies to the local dog park. Numerous dogs sniff this bag daily. It is difficult to keep the white bag clean under these conditions. Otherwise it is an excellent bag.
3,The bag seem smaller than pictured. It feels cheaply made. Can't fit too many stuff.
4,Thought it would be a little bigger

4,I bought this durable bag for a craft project with my preschoolers. Very nice and big and durable. 
4,I’ve ordered three different colors of the solid-colored bags and I’m happy with the quality. They did shrink a bit in the washer/dryer but that’s to be expected with the material. They are much smaller than the picture shows so pay attention to the measurements and then count on losing a few inches because of shrinkage. I knocked off a star because of the false advertising of the picture of the woman holding a bag. I still recommend the bag though. 
4,Good material made for a cute project for teachers last year. They still enjoy them. 
4,Smaller than what I expected but very nice material 
4,Cute 
4,This bag is designed as pictured and will serve as an easy bag for quick runs which is the purpose it was purchased for. It is spacious and well crafted and the canvas material is light but durable... it should last. If it the canvas material was heavier I would have given 5 stars. Good value for money! 
4,I am embroidery it to make personal but this is not very heavy. Sewed nicely. 
4,These bags are perfect for my intended use which is to advertise my son's business. We applied heat transfer vinyl using a heat press to display his logo. The bag has been used to carry clothing supplies. So far so good!!! 
4,I used this product to put my bridesmaids’ gifts in for them to use on the wedding day! They all loved them and it was big enough to keep everything they needed with them. 
4,Food cans 
4,One person found this helpful
4,Liked my bag 
4,Great as a bag but if you're wanting to iron on HTV nope....not the bag for it. This holds a lot of weight I put my laptop two notebooks a binder and nurse kit and it was super sturdy.
4,Really durable . Wish the straps were bigger but it’s a nice size for unisex . I’ll order again 
1,I liked the tote but I payed for and ordered a set of three came in a packi just got one in a pack 
1,This bag is faded looking and washes terribly. I put HTV vinyl on it and couldn’t get it to stick at all due to the weave on the canvas. I’ve made hundreds of canvas bags with HTV and never had this problem. 
1,I bought this bag because I needed specific dimensions to carry a specific item. The picture of the dimensions is totally misleading. You would assume that you could put something in it with a width of 18 inches and a depth of 3 1/2 inches easily. Not the case at all. The 18 inches in the picture is a flat dimension. The 4 1/2 inch dimension is the width of the colored panel at the bottom and does not translate into a 4 1/2 panel up the sides. Even though the bag does not meet my specific need it will suffice to keep in the car to go for groceries otherwise this thing would be returned now. 
1,I ordered 12 for $60 and only received one bag:( 
1,Attached is a photo of a cutout of the fabric on a textile scale. As you can see the cotton is coming in at 321gsm which is under 10oz. The product listing shows 12oz which is supposed to be 375gsm. I'm tired of the China factories lying about their products. 
1,Ripped out on me within a couple months 
1,Not canvas. 
1,I ordered the bag for black Friday shopping after seeing the picture of the girl with it. I should have paid more attention to the actual measurements. The pictures are false advertising! 
1,These totes are okay quality - nothing special. SUPER disappointed that the return window is 1 month. I was possibly going to use these as bridesmaid gifts and now I am unable to return. Very disappointed. 
1,"Actual dimensions 17x13x5 not 18.5x15x5. Poorly made. The colored bottom is a separate piece; it does not reinforce the bag's strength as would be the case in a sturdy bag. The carrying capacity (weight) depends completely on the strength of the stitching that holds the colored bottom to the canvas sides. The stitches are big and the fabric flimsy. Not ""super sturdy"". This is the quality of a cheap give-away bag that you might pick up at a convention. I am returning it. "
1,This bag is SO MUCH smaller than the pictures suggest! I bought this bag as a travel bag for my dog but there is no way it’s big enough to hold more than his food and MAYBE a bowl. It was even shipped in an inner packaging bag so my tote was dirty when it arrived. Incredibly disappointed. 
1,Too small and not durable
1,It didn’t even have a zipper or snap 
1,The devil is a lie! The bag they sent is small and rinky dink. Absolutely NOT the bag in the picture. The picture shows a larger capacity bag. This is a small to medium size regular shopping bag. Not worth the $8. This is maybe a $2 bag. The quality is decent but definitely too small for the price paid. Returning this and looking for something better. 
1,I ONLY RECEIVED 3 BAGS AND I ORDERED 12! 
1,Bag is smaller than described. Not the same one shown in the image provided by seller. 
1,Cheaply made! 
1,Way smaller than in the pictures. What a shame. 
1,Fell apart in the first wash. It looks nice but no longevity. 
1,Not strong enough fabric 
1,Received item and it was dirty. Had grease like spots on it. Very unhappy. 
1,canvas bag that is stained after washing. 
1,Much much smaller than the photos represent. Not useful for what I need. 
2,These bags used to have amazing quality but the last 7 cases i ordered haven't been the same. Every single tote in each case or 24 has had some kind of stain a run in the fabric and/or significant pilling. Very disappointed. 
2,I was looking for a bag that I could lift with one hand swing my elbow through and slide to my shoulder. The handles on this bag are just not long enough for that. It requires both hands be involved. I already had a bag of that ilk so this gets returned. 
2,It’s a nice bag BUT COULD BE MUCH THICKER! 
2,These are fine bags until you wash them. Then the red dye bleeds and the bag gets pink blotches all over that don’t come out. 
2,Good for reusable grocery only in my opinion. No body or sturdiness. Wanted to use for a cricut project but too flimsy. 
2,Not strong enough 
2,Typical canvas bag the photo of its size is VERY deceiving. It is durable and would be ok for crafts but not grocery or storage. 
2,i returned this item because it was a lot smaller than i anticipated it being. 
5,I use this bag for all my BSF paraphernalia. It’s thick and durable and serves my purposes perfectly. One time I even left a wipes container open and it leaked moisture through my entire BSf notebook but it did not penetrate the bag. I have not washed it so I cannot comment about that.
5,Honestly I wish I had found this at dollar tree instead of here for $8 or whatever I paid but honestly it’s exactly what i was looking for so who cares. I’ll make up the $7 difference not buying a coffee on my way to BSF this week. 
5,Listing is 100% correct When I got the bag out of the package I tried to break it and could not. Very durable would easily hold 33 pounds easily. I tested the bag out for durability and could not get it to fail. Five star rating 
5,These bags are super sturdy and hold a lot!
5,Bought these for hubby to transport his lunch bag thermos and other items to and from work. He thinks they're wonderful!
5,Love that they are a 3 pack and the price is unbeatable. Made of sturdy canvas with reinforced stitching.
5,A good size for groceries perfect size for library books good handles for shoulder or arm. Flat bottom no ripping with heavy items. Much better than reuseable grocery bags. 
5,Everything fits in it that I need to take 
5,I got this bag to try my first iron on cricut project and so far I love it. The material is a good thickness so I don't think it'll rip easily and the vinyl adhered with no issues. I'll definitely buy more in other colors. 
5,Perfect totes to personalize. I bought these to machine embroider an appliqué I designed. I was worried that these would be too thin and cheaply made but I was pleasantly surprised. The canvas fabric is of medium thickness with decent stitching. Sure comparing it with my old COSTCO canvas tote this one is lower in quality. But for the price I thought they were great as a personalized gift.
5,The tote fit into my 170x200mm hoop without a problem but it might be a tight fit for larger hoops designed for home machines. I used a tear away stabilizer cotton fabric for appliqué and a combination of polyester and rayon threads. There was no puckering and my home machine had no problems stitching. I was very pleased with the results. I especially love the vibrant red color which complimented my embroidery design. I ended up making 4 of these as a gift. I will definitely buy again for my next project. 
5,I keep ordering more of these. They work well with my iron-on designs (from my Cricut). I usually use these to make teacher gifts or auction items. Everybody loves them. They are large and not that thinner bag material. 
5,Bought these to personalize with heat transfer vinyl for a group. They looked amazing!! Very sturdy I still see several people using them for heavy items on a regular basis with no issues. They were true white with a nice clean black handle and bottom border. Definitely will use again. They would also handle being painted with fabric paint screen printing ect. 
5,The wide space allows items like bread loaves and egg cartons to lie flat. Also perfect to avoid spills from meat and seafood trays.
5,They are strong and easy to clean. These bags get compliments all the time from the cashiers and baggers at my grocery stores.
5,Great as a gift. 
5,Added an iron on I made with a cricut after purchase! Very pleased with the size and sturdiness of the bag! Would be great for grocery shopping or going to the beach! 
5,Easy to sublimate- sturdy strong and durable! Love these bags!! 
5,Great for shopping. I use mine when if I have to make a short trip. Carries everything I need. 
5,I'll use it for groceries. 
5,I found these bags to be of sturdy construction. The stitching was solid with no flaws. The material was heavy duty and has handled washing well. 
5,Great bag for heavy groceries and holds a lot. I will definitely order 3 more bags. 
5,I have been looking for a nice durable and cost effective bag to purchase. We are going to put our business logo on and gift to our patients. This is way better then we hoped for. It's sturdy roomy and perfect!!!! I'll take pictures and post after we get our logos on. =)
5,Nice large sturdy totes with strong straps. Quality product. 
5,I was not expecting too much since the bag was so inexpensive. But This bag was a better quality than I expected for the price.
5,I personalized them and gave away as gifts! Everyone loved them!!
5,Will definitely order again!!! 
5,Just the size I was looking for. 
5,Great value and looks!! 
5,Simple sturdy perfect size. I use it to carry a small coffee maker when I travel. (I must have my morning coffee.) It also holds the 2 mugs coffee pods and sugar etc. I wore out the predecessor so had to replace it. I searched for the perfect size and price. And bonus I could choose a color. 
5,These are great quality bags for a great price. I bought these to silkscreen and give to our friends family and clients for our Bloody Mary and Michelada mix Bloody Gerry. Everyone absolutely loves these bags! We are very happy with them and will continue purchasing. 
5,Now that New Jersey has banned plastic bags in food stores and supermarkets these canvas totes have become our go to favorite for bagging our stuff to take home.
5,Size - perfect
5,Function - excellent
5,Quality - excellent
5,Value - excellent 
5,Great Christmas gifts 
5,I used these bags as a thank gift for my parent helper. My kids put their painted hand prints in the bag and the bag took the paint really well. Heavy duty bag. Would buy again! 
5,I was skeptical about this purchase but upon its arrival I was in awe of its sturdiness and threading. The handles have the crisscross stitch to enhance the strength of them. The base expands out as advertised. I am able to add my iron-ons to it without failure. My sister and daughter love these bags! I ordered a black and beige and solid black (still awaiting the arrival of that one for a week now). They’re definitely worth the money! 
5,Perfect for my bridesmaid bags. Easy to apply heat transfer vinyl to and it holds a good amount. Very happy with this purchase. 
5,Love this tote bag. I use it every day for work. It's just the size and look I wanted and I can easily throw it in the wash. Very happy with this purchase. 
5,I wanted to find a nice reusable bag to keep all of my groceries in. I leave this one in the car and it is very useful! 
5,I got the grey color it appears and feels of quality. We've had it about 3 months now and it's held up wonderfully. I got the dark color since they sometimes fall to the floor/pulled across the classroom- but the grey is a nice darker shade looks new still. 
5,Very sturdy bag 
5,Perfect size to hold lots of gifts for our end of the year teacher present. Feels thick and very sturdy. Added plus is the heat transfer vinyl adhered to it just fine. 
5,i bought it to use as a grocery bag since bags are 25¢ in san francisco. it’s sturdy and large enough to fit a good amount of things and cute as well. i imagine it could also be a good bag for school (to fit a lapop and a couple notebooks). overall i recommend it’s a great bag for the price. flex on em at trader joe’s! 
5,So glad I finally bought these. Use for grocery shopping and they’re perfect. I keep a few in the car for random stops at the store. Can sling a full bag onto shoulder to free up hands. Very sturdy. They shrank after wash so hang dry. Might drag on ground for someone under 5’5” when carrying by handle. 
5,Great quality for the price! Easy to add heat transfer vinyl too. I wish it had a zipper closure but other than that these are amazing! The small canvas bag in photo does not come with this. This was the only photo I had. It was a gift for my mother in law for her devotional items. She loved it! I was skeptical because of the price but these are great quality. 
5,Such a. Great bag I got for a sublimation image and it worked amazing ???? 
5,I love these bags they are sturdy and just throw them in wash whenever you like. 
5,Trim looks good and bag is very durable. 
5,"I bought this to use as a ""reusable"" gift bag for a bunch of baby shower gifts including a pillow and stuffed animal which take up a lot of space! This is so worth the money compared to an extra large paper gift bag which will just be thrown away. Now mommy has a convenient tote too! I searched and searched and finally came upon this very large inexpensive tote! I'm thrilled! "
5,Very nice and sturdy bag 
5,I got these because plastic bags were driving me crazy around the house. The only things I would add is a zipper/flap top and some kind of hard bottom shell. I love these bags and use them often I have not washed them yet but I don't doubt they will last. Plus I adore the burnt orange color. I will be ordering more I would trust these walking down the street. 
5,Was hesitant to purchase this bag because I am gifting it but am very happy with the quality of it! 
1,This is the first time purchased. It is not expensive so I am not upset. You get what you pay for. Just thought it would make it for a little while it is canvas. Stitching didn't hold through the first wash on delicate. DO NOT WASH!!! I can hand stitch and still use. Just think about what you want it for.
1,Not worth the cost . Bags are very small not what I expected and the received gift was dissapointed.
1,Poor quality. Use as bag for my wheel chair.
1,Terrible quality it went bad after one use.
1,Did not like it at all
1,Out of 10 bags I kept 3. The rest were full of stains.
1,not strong at all surprisingly small thin fabric
1,You can see through the fabric
1,These are see through. I can see the tag and the other side through the front. Very cheap feeling bag
1,Just purchased as didn’t last at all the few we used already.
1,I dislike that they are as sturdy as the beige canvcan bags (65) I ordered an they were suppose to be the same bags just white in color.
1,These canvas bags are so thin you can almost see through them.
1,I tried my transfers on one and it bleed through to the other side.
1,Just a waste of money I don’t have.
1,The bags are stained and too small.
1,Wasn’t what I expected they had a little fray on each of them and they are small and very thin not made to last but they will work for a one time thing
1,I ordered a 12 pack to see how they would work for sublimation and company was nice and helpful explained I needed to purchase a bulk amount (500) and they said they would give discount code. Told them for 2 months how much I needed and when came time to order they gave me a code that would ONLY work for 6 more packs than I was ordering. So not only did they try to bully me into buying more I didn't need but when they came in several had marks on them were ripped and unusable. One pack smelled so bad of mold/mildew I had to close it immediately and also put it in a scented bag so didn't smell it. If I didn't have to finish a BIG job I would have returned all of them but did not have time to do that cause had to get job done by January. Will never buy again
1,Prewashed to do HTV for Halloween bags and pretty much trash… strings coming out of every seam. Waste of money would not recommend! Un-useable. Very thin fabric
1,Out of the 12 bags 6 were damaged. They were either ripped stained or written on with pen. They are NOT as wide as shown. The handles we’re hanging on by a thread…literally. All the seams were so loose. The bags were practically see through. Definitely don’t use for groceries as the bags can probably barley hold 1 pound. Handles are not sturdy at all. Great for HTV projects but wouldn’t recommend.
1,Way smaller than they appear in the pic. Yes they match the measurements in description found on the product page if you look hard enough however the pictures are extremely misleading they are very small and more rectangle than that appear
1,I had to return these because I bought them so use as bridesmaids beach totes and these are way too small they are the size of a textbook. The material is see-through canvas and the straps are cheaply made.
1,I bought these to make gifts for friends. I was very disappointed when I received them and they were so thin I could see through them easily and I worried they wouldn’t hold much without breaking. I’m sure I could have used them if I wasn’t planning on having the recipient use much in them but it’s for a book group and it certainly won’t hold more than 1 book so it won’t work for me. I returned them and got my money back.
1,I am extremely disappointed in these bags. Many were not sewn with frayed seams. The majority were dirty or stained. The smell when you applied iron-on was disgusting. The only reason I didn't return was because I needed them that day. I am embarrassed to have to use them at the corporate meeting. DO NOT BUY!
1,Got these for resale when I applied a Cricut image. The handle melted on the first one I did. Will not buy again.
1,These came in a sealed plastic bag - but when I opened the bag - the bags smelled like a nasty musty basement . There was no getting that smell out. I purchased them to give them as gifts wirh printed images on them- no way of getting that smell out- I returned them.
1,Total disappointment. This is not “thick and sturdy” as it claims in the description. The material is so thin you can see through it. The item came folded and the handles are all wrinkled. The handles ade shiny and flimsy.
1,Not very good quality. Bought to do a craft. The thread was coming out of the bags some of the bags in the middle had brown stains on them and what I received was not as pictured or anything like the reviews I read. Definately would not purchase again. Very disappointing.
1,Bag is much smaller than the photos. Extremely smaller. A medium size magazine is all that can fit in it. Fabric is so thin its almost see through. straps are very very short.
1,I loved the size and simplicity of the bags. However I bought a pack of 12 bags that were suppose to be new and they were not. Some of the bags were used and had food stains on them I was only able to use 6 of the 12 bags. What a disappointment.
1,These were a disappointment. Very thin and the handles were very flimsy. They were also small. I was using them for gifts for piano recital so will have to make do I will need bigger bags for some
1,These bags were WAY smaller than expected. In the advertisement the picture of the bag was very large when they arrived they were only big enough to fit a couple sheets of paper. The material is also not sturdy and poorly made. I wont be buying this item again.
1,Poor stitching. Buy if you aren't thinking of putting anything in it. Awful as a bag.
1,4 of the bags had holes on the side seams out of the bag. I'm certain the others would have ripped the first time they were used. Not worth it even though they were a good price as they will all end up useless quickly.
1,Very disappointed in this product. The bags are WAY smaller than shown in the photos. Very deceptive images to entice people to purchase. I cannot use these for my original intent.
1,What came is not what is pictured. the strap is not sturdy canvas (as in the picture) and the bottom is not sewn properly and it's way smaller than the photo. Very sad waste of money. False advertising.
1,"Thought these would ""hang"" right but seems designed for children  not adults. They are too small."
1,I like the size of these but there is a large water stain visible through the clear packaging....I'm really nervous to see how many are going to have this because I must have enough for Friday for swag bags!
1,There was so much loose thread. Looks nothing like the picture the lady is holding. A couple of them have rips in the middle. I really need all 12 so this is very dissapointing.
1,I purchased these blank canvas totes for my Girl Scout Troop to decorate. 4 of the 12 bags were written on and Not Usable. Very frustrating! These bags can not be returned either. Bad product would not recommend!
1,Muy pequeñas para lo que demuestran en la foto. Mala calidad del material no me sirven para las compras.
1,I bought them to make my bridesmaids bags and they were so crappy and falling apart I did not end up using.
1,Nice just too thin for the painting/gifting we do with them.
1,Needed more durability
1,The product was smaller than listed in the description and the fabric is so thin you can see through it. They look very low quality and I returned the item.
1,You get what you pay for. Very cheaply made so much so that a few them had holes in the bottom from where the stitching let loose. Invest in something better
1,Look to cheap for the adults I was going to give them to
1,The bags were much smaller than the pictures represented. They are definitely not for adults. Also there was a lot of hanging thread. Returning them!
1,Poor quality.
1,These bags were not canvas but cheap very 4th in oseberg like fabric. Not at all what I thought the would be.
1,So disappointed. Very bad quality. Has so many loose thread and few has stains or some had writing with marker inside.
1,Size is very small
1,These are really small
1,These items shrink several inches in length and width when washed. They are poorly made have tons of loose strings.
1,The quality of these bags is less than horrible. Within a day the handles were detaching.
1,Bags were smaller than I expected and the stitching on them was awful and fell apart.
1,Received stained bags that were poorly sewn. Overall quality was very poor. Would not order again.
1,Too small and cheap fabric..
1,Cheap material. The straps are not canvas material
1,Very cheap looking. Ended up returning
1,These bags are not very good quality. Thin material.
1,Was not the size advertised! Will not order again.
1,These are very cheaply made. Returning them
1,So thin and not hemmed. Won’t not buy again
1,way smaller then i thought! had to return
1,Very small not what i had pictured when ordered.
1,Really poor quality.
1,Extremely thin
1,NOT GOOD QUALITY
1,Poorly sewed together.
1,First bag I pulled out strap was bad
1,Not good
1,Had to return they definitely are much smalle then they say.
1,Sorry had to give low score. It was too thin.
1,I don't think everyone is getting the same thing when these are ordered. I ordered 3 sets for a project and decided not to use them because they were such cheap fabric and smaller than advertised. Mine are white with white straps - not canvas. I decided to use them as book bags in my classrooms for the students to store the books they are reading and their writing notebooks (3rd grade.) We have been using them for 2 weeks and two of them have already torn beyond repair. They are used 5 days a week (8 days total at this point) for about 30 minutes a day to carry a very light load. The stitching along the sides has completely torn like perforated paper. I doubt these will last a full month.
1,They are not canvas and they are MINI bags they are not the ones in the photo do not buy them
1,The bags are a much smaller size than you see in the photograph.
2,Very beautiful but not very durable.
2,This style bag was requested by my child’s preschool. The canvas in these is on the thinner side (compared to those at Michael’s) and after two uses - carrying a folder with just a feel sheets of paper and a little snack bag) the bottom seam was opened there is a three inch hole in the bottom of the bag. Not the quality I expected.
2,We thought these were going to be great unfortunately after a couple uses the bag shredded at the seam and everything fell out. Not as sturdy as we had hoped for.
2,both lasted for about 2-3 weeks before they ripped ?????? was very not poggers:((
2,Not what I needed
2,There’s a stock pic above showing these bags FULL of fruits? Yeaaaa if you used one of these bags for that it would rip pretty fast. If you plan on using these bags for light stuff to transport then why’re ok. Not worth the money tho I’m general!
2,Low quality I can’t use it to paint.
2,Had to put a stiffer bag inside of these when used. Extremely thin. Bought to put my logo on. I would never even consider washing them they’re so thin.
2,They are not sturdy cheap made
2,I machine washed them and they are pretty bad now with wrinkles and shrinking. To be fair the tag does give explicit warnings not to machine wash. Still rather disappointing.
2,I was under the impression that each bag came with an iron on sheet
2,These are very cheaply made and half of the box had some sort of water damage so they are basically trash.
2,The bag is flimsy and will fade when washed
2,Tried to use for sublimation.. they looked burnt even at lower temps
2,Material is very thin and lightweight. Woven shoulder straps are short. Okay for kid party favors not for groceries gym or books.
2,Was sewn together poorly. Very flimsy. Won’t buy again
2,I ordered 2 packages. One was fine the other was moldy.I will be returning the moldy one.
2,I don’t usually give bad reviews even if the product isn’t great I try to be understanding and polite. This is not one of those reviews. I needed these bags to fill orders and they are nothing like the product description. They are cheap and thin and nothing like the description thick and sturdy. Thankfully I have a steamer to get the wrinkles out of the mangled looking handles. You can see my hand through the bag in the second picture. Will not be purchasing these again!
2,Cheap material for canvas. So lightweight that it will wear out fast!
2,These were ordered for a bachelorette weekend trip as a welcome gift for all. They arrived later than expected and didn’t make the welcome gift unfortunately.
2,These bags a very small. Way smaller than shown on the picture. Not much fits in them.
2,Unfortunately the handles are coming off the bag. Great price but recommend reinforcing the handles
2,Not as thick as expected but it does the job as a bag.
2,The quality of the bag is not the best made. Really thin material...that when I glue gunned items onto the bag both sides of the bag stuck together. When I drew on the bag with a sharpie the ink went through. The bags came very wrinkled..had to really iron them. One even had a stain on it...would not buy again.
2,I bought these for my bridesmaids. I wanted to paint doily patterns etc. I was half way through my project and I saw a few had dirt on them but I was worried until the lady one had the #129 written on it. I know I should have checked all the bags first but I was in a hurry. I’m really disappointed because at first glance they seemed really cute.
2,I purchased these to decorate as teacher gifts. I planned to decorate them the day they arrived and send them to school the next day. Well they stink... literally. I already threw them in the wash once and they still smell like someone’s musty old attic. On to plan B for a gift bc there is no way I’m gifting something that smells this bad.
2,Way too small for book bags in the classroom.
2,Tiny I could only assume these were designed for children certainly not practical as a gift or for shopping for an adult. Cheaply made strap especially was cheap. Now don't get me wrong the price is cheap so if you wanted a fun tie die project for your kids then these would be perfect. Just did not fit my needs and was returned for a full refund.
2,If you want these as party favors bag then they will work other than that they aren’t useful for anything. A great price but they are super small and the handles are poorly sewn on. Do not recommend
2,They aren't the size I thought they were going to be based on the photos. These bags are small you are not able to put it on your shoulder as advertised. You can only hold them in your hand. They are not wide at all and are also somewhat thin. Unfortunately will have to return.
2,Was a little disappointed when I opened the package to find the first bag was defective. There is a hole down the side of the bag and the material is fraying. The other bags are intact but the quality is not the best. Material is thin and handles are not centered on all the bags.
2,The bags are perfect for a birthday party craft I am extremely disappointed that 3 of them have issues. 2 bags have poor quality threading and one has a yellow stain.
2,I wanted to like these. However they arrived and were quite small (smaller than the measurements). They feel very cheaply made one was actually broken on arrival and one was missing. I bought them because the price seemed great but you definitely sacrifice quality.
2,Some of them where stained
2,Very disappointed in these totes. They are listed as polyester canvas totes but every one I pressed the images were very dull and blurry. Not to mention the size of the bag. EXTREMELY SMALL!!
2,Used these for my students' math bags and they ripped by November. They only held a white board and dry erase marker. The handles fell apart and some ripped.
2,Way too small even if the meture is listed the picture is not accurate and give you the idea that is bigger they should not show this picture.
2,Way smaller than expected
2,Some of my tote bags had stains on them.
2,The quality was not that great so I had to return them.
2,They smelled strongly like mildew!
2,Cheap thin quality but good for a child’s craft product
2,Much smaller than the photos let on.
2,Unprofessional cheap quality
2,Liked the price but the bags were thin and small.
2,Quality was real poor. Thread sticking out everywhere.
2,They were small and not of good quality
2,These are smaller than I thought. It does mention I see now the measurements so it is my fault for not checking but I assumed they were typical canvas grocery bags. They are fine if you need small bags.
2,The fabric leaves much to be desired the size is not practical for me I thought it was bigger it barely fits my arm to be able to carry it as a normal bag
3,I started using these regularly and they were good at first but now it’s balling. I’ve been using it normally and it’s still doing it
3,the bags were much wider than they appeared in the picture which was disappointing because i specifically wanted narrower bags and i looked forever to find some. i came across these and liked the narrow width so i bought them but when they came they were extremely wide.
3,So the material was nice enough for a tote bag but a couple days after receiving it I decided to wash it and the seams BUSTED open to make it unusable! I guess you could wash on a gentle cycle hand wash or just don't wash it and you're fine.
3,One of my bags got a tear in the seem after single use. Not durable
3,This is a good product just wish it was sturdier/durable. The handles are already tearing at the seams.
3,Thin for their size but they're holding up OK for now. I think I'd want something a little thicker and better made next time around. There are definitely worse canvas bags out there don't get me wrong they're no where near the worst bags but don't expect them to last years.
3,The one bag is fine but other had poor stitching on the seam and fell apart instantly. Not worth the hassle to send back since the second bag is fine and the price was cheap but you get what you pay for sometimes
3,these bags both get stained very easily
3,Super thin- not what was expected.
3,It’s a couple of bags- no decorations but I wanted them simple
3,These are handy sturdy bags. I bought many in both colors. They are strong have held up very well. I use them daily for all sorts of things.
3,I came back today to get more only to find a big jump in price.
3,Two stars off for the egregious price hike.
3,On 5/1/21 I paid $8.99 for the tan and the black versions of these bags. Now 2/21/22 the cost is $12.99 for each color. From the same seller CVNDKN.
3,That is roughly a 45% increase in less than a year.
3,They are available from other sellers here at better prices. Also as usual similar bags of a wide variety are available too. I went a different direction in my order after seeing the price change.
3,Thinner than expected. Don't know how much weight it could carry.
3,We did not have time to wash the bags to remove the scent but the bags were useful to our Team.
3,I ordered and payed for 200 but my box only has 100 in it- is there anything I can do to get the other 100- but good quality- they wash and wrinkle.
3,The exterior packaging was fine so I assume the damage occurred during manufacturing or before they were packaged.
3,Thin
3,The bags are very light weight. I plan to machine embroider on them and they afe light enough to put in the hoop easily. They did not send the teflon sheet. Reading reviews I'm not the only one. I don't need it for what I'm doing but why say your sending something yoh should send it.
3,Very flimsy… cute and arrived quickly but are super thin
3,These are a little thin for what I use them for. I hand paint on them so I find that that they are thin. Those I buy from Hobby Lobby and other craft stores are much thinker.
3,Pricey but compare averagely with similar bags I’ve purchased.
3,I thought it would be thicker fabric. The lightweight fabric is nice however I dislike that the bottom is just a pleat and does not flatten out at all. It worked well with my vinyl iron-on but I will look for a thicker and flat bottom bag for future use.
3,The sewing and the fabric quality is not very good.
3,These totes are definitely thinner than I was hoping for but seem to be ok quality for the price.
3,Great price for bulk bags. The bags themselves are pretty thin and don’t feel like they would hold up to a lot of books or things put in them
3,Although these bags are good size and very sturdy fabric fades quickly and picks up lint easily.
3,Awesome for the price but it’s small and not the same size as described. Returning.
3,These are good and cheap to leave in the car for shopping trips. They hold a decent amount of items. However I suggest hand washing and hang drying. These shrank after the wash and then some in the dryer. I wet the bags and tried to hand stretch them out but I was not able to get them back into their original size.
3,We bought thinking we'd add our own designs with our cricut vinyl. The vinyl didn't stick. Infusable did kinda tho so it wasn't a total loss. We just have a bag with half a pic now.??
3,the bags are thin but good for the price. infusible ink will not work on them but iron on vinyl will. the teflon sheet never came with
3,Thin and see-through not a bad cheap bag but I’m not thrilled with the quality. Still debating if I’m going to return or use for giveaways. But at the same time giving them away to promote an item… we’ll see
3,After they were washed they shrunk up and wrinkled a lot. Not bag for the price sinxe In using these for practice projects but won't purchase again.
3,i wanted a nice durable pack of tote bags however this is not it. you really get what you pay for. it is such a thin fabric and it feels really cheap. i used these to screenprint and the ink would transfer onto the back of the tote bag so it is not the best.
3,They need to be bigger for Halloween
3,Make sure to read the product dimensions...which are accurate...and not estimate size of tote based on photos with model (must have been taken on a Barbie doll!) Tote is very small I'm using as gift bags for a bachelorette weekend so it works. But not spacious. Quality should be okay for gift bag not sure it it would hold a lot otherwise. Considering price point...I got what I paid for.
3,I open the bag thinking they where heavy & thick but they are thin
3,Every bag was different sizes. So that made it difficult because I did iron on vynil on them and had to measure and adjust sizes so it would fit in. Other then that I really like the quality. I guess it worked out at the end.
3,so i gave it less stars because that pic one was misleading. they r small bags. you could barely fir anything in them
3,The bags aren’t bad; but was surprised when 2 of my bags handles had the threads pulled out so they were nothing but tangled. I ended up having to throw them away.
3,The handles of the bags were smaller than expected. Material thinner than what I needed it for. Good for giveaways but that’s about it.
3,The “canvas” tote is decent for the price (ordered for a class craft project)  but it is not thick canvas and it is not tightly woven as shown in photo. The color is not eggshell or natural with white straps but is completely white and the straps have a shine to them.
3,Thought bags were bigger but they are smaller I mean it’s ok but I would’ve liked to have a bigger tote bag and they are as sturdy and tough as they claim to be pretty thin and light weight I can still use them though but I won’t buy again they are strong enough or big enough for my liking
3,It was a great bag but just a little small for what I was doing.
3,Got these as gift bags for a girls weekend. A mall printing company is decorating them. I needed 10 but got this 12 pack since it was a good price. Good thing I only needed 10 because there were only 11 in the package and one of them was dirty (will use it for small groceries). So not the greatest purchase but for the price it met my needs.
3,Looks like I was a lucky one! I tried to cancel after reading reviews ( should have read reviews first) but it was too late. I was pleased to get them intact no rips or writing. As someone mentioned before the pictures are misleading they are small. And not the best quality you get what you pay for.
3,I thought they were bigger than this
3,I bought these to decorate as gifts and they are great for that. Worked well with my fabric markers. One bag has a torn notch as the top and I cannot use it. I would like to get a replacement but can’t figure out how to do that.
3,They look cheap. I will use these but will not buy again. And you can see through them...
3,I bought them as favor bags for my daughters paint party. They are exactly as described but I though the could be better quality. My daughter decorated them so they worked well. The worked for the purpose I needed them so no complaints
3,they are ok smaller than i thought and you cannot fit much
3,Smaller than I had expected them to be but will still work for my project. I dont think they would hold up very long with heavy duty use but with occasional use they'll be just fine.
3,I read the dimensions but they're still a little smaller than I thought they would be.. I screen printed some designs onto them and it went straight through so the fabric is really really thin. (thankfully I put cardboard between the layers...)
3,The bag was just what I was looking for but they smell awful. I ironed a design on and the smell was terrible. Hopefully a wash will help.
3,I got the wrong color i didnt want white. They are too thin.
3,The bags came smelling of mildew one bag even has stains and mold spots on it. Bags themselves seem sturdy and are a decent size.
3,From the pictures posted it is not the same size as pictured. The bags will work but will not hold a whole lot.
3,A little smaller than I thought. Barely fits a folder
3,Not as big as thought and thin. Get what you pay for
3,Not as big or as sturdy as expected but will use them as gift bags
3,Nice bags though they smelled funny...Let them airdry and smell went away...
3,Too small
3,Fine for what they are: slightly cheap canvas totes. Big enough for a couple pairs of adult flip flops for reference.
3,These are great for a child craft activity but beware... I only received 11.
3,The bags had a strong smell and the handles are poor quality.
3,The straps are shorter than what I had wanted. Lots of extra strings of fabric to cut away.
3,If you intend to use this bag with a heat press be VERY cautious - the handles MELT
3,The size of the bag was good disappointed in the weight of the material
3,They are chill
3,Some bags came dirty like 3 of them
3,Thought it was big but they are small
3,Smaller than I thought they would be....
3,These bags are smaller than pictured. A couple of them came with loose strings and the stitching wasn’t straight on a few of the bags. These issues are not a big deal to me as I plan on using them to hold Christmas gifts for my nieces and nephews. It’s perfect to personalize with an iron on. Overall it was a decent product for the price.
3,Super small bag. Picture is not accurate unless model holding back is a very small child . These bags are very small.
3,What the picture shows is not what you get they are way smaller
3,Reviewed in Canada on September 20 2019
3,Nice bags
4,I like the bags. They are a good size and seem well made. Although I pulled them out and one of them had a stain. It looks like a black thread got woven in there… it’s alright though because I plan on painting over it though.
4,decent product although one of my bag’s straps ripped off the bag. i had almost nothing in it so i’m a little confused
4,might be low quality
4,These are definitely what you pay for they’d be great for shopping though I like to use tote bags to carry around my daily items. They’re a bit thin.
4,Great but the fabric has gotten a lot of thread pulls after one use
4,I purchased these bags for heavy items such as soda wine or cleaning products.
4,Solid and simple.
4,Bigger than I expected. I bought these to monogram for teacher gifts. They are perfect for what I’m using them for
4,These are very nice bags and seem well made. I especially like the large capacity which makes it well suited for groceries. However given the height of the bag the handles are too long. I’m 5-11 and when I carry them they just touch the ground. Thus I have to lift the bags a bit higher and that gets tiresome after a while. I suppose you could sling it over the shoulder like a purse but that’s not what I was looking for. Will experiment with tying knots in the handles to shorten them. Just be aware.
4,Had to iron it to be able to put our logo on it
4,I use this bag any time I need to go out or simply buy groceries. It's simple and really cute for a day out! It hasn't broken so far and I can't really complain about anything. Would buy again. :)
4,Great value for the price. I wish the handles were a little longer but overall sturdy cute and take paint well for decorating.
4,I love it! Bur not so durable
4,Happy with the quality of this bag not satisfied with the shipment or how much we were charged. Something here is really fishy the quantity we ordered vs what we got didn't make any sense. We returned we didn't get back what we paid for the overage. The bag themselves are acceptable and what was expected however the company is very shady and there isn't much I can do about that because of the way they shipped the products vs how they charged us for the products. Very unhappy customer.
4,It says it’s good for tie-dye but it’s not! The bags molded and the dye color did not stick to it! I can’t return the item for a refund because they are all molded. And I can’t contact the seller to ask for my money back! What a scam.
4,I didn’t like the material. Very thin
4,this product didn't meet my expectations it's not the seller's fault. It's made with cotton but not good quality. I don't recommend it if you want to do craft or decorate it. It was hard to iron once I washed it.
4,Once I received my order there were strands hanging out of every corner it was so thin very see-through. I couldn’t sell them or do any design because then it would look patchy and it was just not a good product overall.
4,It only comes with on one film to cover one bag not 100
4,I would have given this a better rating if I received all 5 bags but I only received 3. I didn't do anything at the time since I needed to decorate one bag as a gift...
4,Not durable whatsoever feels like something I would throw away not keep. Returning ASAP.
4,I bought these to sublimate on. Can’t use for that purpose and material way to thin. Also bought the red ones can’t use them
4,It seemed like a good purchase based off the now-realized-fabricated reviews but the bag is so thin it's almost transparent and the photo of the Teflon makes it seem like you get a roll but it's a small little sheet. Save your money unless you want cheap totes for kids that won't hold.
4,The package came wet and when I opened it all of the tote bags stink like a crop of potatoes. All of them are drench and stained in a dark brown color on the right side of the bag. I've never been this disappointed ordering something online.
4,I really thought these would be a regular weight canvas bag very thin cotton too light weight seems flimsy not sturdy to carry much weight.
4,If you are looking for a super light weight bag these would be great great value.
4,I thought the tote bags would have been a little heavier. Otherwise they are nice.
4,They're a little see-though but they do the job.
4,I ordered this set to make an end of the year gift for the kids in my preschool class. I used my Cricut and some iron-on vinyl on them. They are a good size for what I was looking for and I like them. I was prepared for some extra strings after reading reviews. They were easy to snip off. The bags did have a slightly weird smell but it didn’t bother me too much. I only gave it 4 stars because a couple of the bags had a stray black mark and because I only received 11 bags instead of 12. Other than that they were what I needed and I would order them again.
4,Ok so these are WAY smaller than advertised
4,You can maybe use them as a small gift bag or lunch sack. I was bummed when I opened them
4,Also the material and quality is pretty cheap.
4,But! I was able to save them by tie dying them and they will work. Just be aware they are tiny
4,A lot of reviews said that the bags were small thin cheaply made and had loose strings hanging form it. If you take some precautions you should be fine. Originally I wanted my guests to be able to paint on their bags and to use them to carry one to two books. We painted on them with acrylic paint and it came out wonderful. Since they were a little thin I put a piece of card stock in the bag before we painted them if I hadn't have done that the paint would have seeped through the other side. There weren't that many loose strings and the ones that were hanging off I snipped with some scissors. The bags are small you could probably fit one or two books in it or a small stack of paper folders. I tested mine while at the grocery store and it's the perfect for small produce. The bags does feel rough but I suppose that is with any canvas sort of material some of the handles were a little loose but a simple stitch fixes that. For the price it's a good sturdy bag.
4,"I bought these to use as a favor/craft at my daughter's birthday party. They will be fine for that purpose but don't expect to take these with you to do your regular grocery shopping. They will fit a few books and maybe a single change of (kids) clothes but they are not the same size as a typical reusable shopping bag. The bags themselves match the dimension shown (~11""x13"") but I think the scale is off in the pictures showing a woman's hand. And the straps are woven nylon not canvas so I don't think they could handle a lot of weight."
4,I personalized them with HTV (heat transfer vinyl) without any trouble.
4,Even with the downsides I still think they are a good value and will work well for my purposes.
4,Overall these bags were great.
4,They're a bit smaller than your average tote but if you pay attention to the size and know what you're getting you won't be disappointed.
4,The bag is a canvas color and straps are white.
4,Purchased a set of these to customize for bride bridesmaid and flower girl bags and they were perfect for what I intended.
4,Great price perfect size for a robe and wine glass and easy to work with. Girls will definitely reuse. Worked well with foil htv.
4,Large enough to hold 3 or so large adult shirts and a bottle of water comfortably.
4,The straps are short. I can’t use it as a shoulder bag it’s uncomfortable
4,The size is exactly what I was looking for! I thought I was getting a cream/canvas colored tote and these are a really thin white material. They still work for the crafting I purchased them for though so I'll call it a win anyway!
4,Easy to use.
4,Definitely read the reviews and k ow before buying. They are small in size like others notes and the material is thin. They worked well for a craft project we did with a Cub Scout pack. I would buy these again to use as gift bags or party favor bags. I just wouldn’t expect these to hold heavy items.
4,I liked the quality of the bags however (2) of the 48 bags ordered were defective.
4,one had the handle strap seen to the other strap
4,A little thinner than I expected but still good quality.
4,They are good bags I just thought they’d be a little bigger.
4,I really like these totes and would have given a 5 star but one of them had a mark on it( looks like grease and or blood) so that one will be going in the trash.
4,I was a bit disappointed by this item. I had hoped they would be good bags for my Hebrew school students to carry their projects and homework folders in. They were barely big enough for the folder to fit. They are a bit thin too. I added a logo with iron-on paper.
4,Quality of Product was good and sturdy. My granddaughters traced designed on the front and painted them. Although a little smaller than I thought it was a good purchase.
4,The color is nice and the size in the pictures looks bigger than the actual size. If you are looking for a bag for carry groseries or heavy stuff looks somewhere else. However if you need a bag for party favors (like a wedding or birthday) these works good. Is not an espectacular quality but is good for the price.
4,Was able to do my project but bags were not as thick as I expected. Will not order again
5,I bought these for Cub Scouts to decorate and put their books and belts in. The smaller size is perfect for kids to carry and hang on their coat hangers to keep their scout gear in one place.
5,We used these as a give-away at a reunion. The fabric is as described is lightweight but not completely flimsy. We applied iron-on patches to these by slipping a piece of parchment paper inside to make sure the iron-on adhesive didn't seep in too far. The size was just big enough to slip a three-prong folder inside with other small giveaways. These worked great. We were very pleased. Thank you so much!
5,One person found this helpful
5,These where thick enough to not be see through. My kids painted them and stuffed with toys etc. So far they have held up but we have not used them long term yet.
5,I was hesitant to buy because of the reviews that said they came with stains or handles ripped etc. But every one
5,of the bags was clean and in perfect shape. I used them for an art class - the kids (ages 7-12) stamped them using fruit and acrylic paint. They came out beautifully! One suggestion - the canvas is a bit thin so put a piece of cardboard inside when painting. I wouldn't use them for heavy groceries but they will be perfect for school supplies papers or coloring books and crayons.
5,I bought these for favor bags for my daughters birthday. I ironed on the names of her friends. Good quality and no complaints! A few loose strings but they came right off.
5,The bags were smaller than I exprected but its okay cause it is really the size suitable for the intended use. This is perfect for company promotions. I branded the bags with our company logo and placed some promotional items inside and distributed to our partner health clinics. They love it. The fabric is a little thin so I do not recommend this bag for carrying heavy items.
5,Great for a small art project
5,I ordered these bags as a present for my students to decorate for Mother’s Day. The bags turned out wonderfully using acrylic paint. They were a great size large enough for a book or tablet sunscreen and a few other small items. They are lightweight but sturdy bags and the color is just as described.
5,The only recommendation I would make is to put a piece of cardboard or something similar inside if you don’t want the paint to bleed through to the other side.
5,I wouldn’t hesitate to order these bags again especially for the price!
5,Great small lightweight tote bag. Finished well (some of the bags I've bought other places were not). Consistent quality. Lightweight. But perfect for holding small things or for personalized favors for an event.
5,I bought these to make Fire Up bags for my daughter softball tournament. I then had each jersey number silk screened onto each bag. The bags are smaller than I thought. Based on the pictures showing/advertising the bags they appeared large enough to carry over a shoulder but they are not that large. They were perfect for what I needed though.
